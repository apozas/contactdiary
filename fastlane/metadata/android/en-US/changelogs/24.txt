This update brings support to the Galician PassCOVID QR system and adds a chooser for the date of end of contacts (thanks to igor-cali!)

If you want to have the QR system in your region implemented, write an issue in https://www.github.com/apozas/contactdiary, and if you want to help translating Contact Diary to your language, please visit http://www.crowdin.com/project/contactdiary
